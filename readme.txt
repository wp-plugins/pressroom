Turns WordPress into a multiple channel publishing platform.

== Description ==

PressRoom supports the sub-compact publishing model. Content is structured around the concept of Editorial Projects. An Editorial Project contains an unlimited number of Editions, which in turn are collections of posts, pages and custom post types.

Editions can be published to:

- Web as static html
- iOS, feeding a native client based on the open source Baker Framework
- be packaged for the Adobe DPS HTML importer (*)
- published as a Json stream (*)

Suitable for magazines, newspapers or just to manage your static websites and release your blog to multiple channels. PressRoom is being developed around a vision for digital publishing that we see growing and struggling with the available technologies.

(*) not yet ready for public distribution.
